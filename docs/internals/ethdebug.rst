ethdebug Implementation
***********************

This page is aimed at compiler developers.
It describes how the compiler derives the :ref:`ethdebug output <ethdebug>` from its analysis results: how each type of the language maps to the type schema and what the pointers of the state variables look like for each kind of type and location.
The debug info that is passed from the Solidity frontend through Yul is specified in :doc:`ethdebug_internal_debug_info`.

The documents are modelled as data structures in ``liblangutil/EthdebugSchema.h``, one per schema, and serialized to JSON from there.
The constructors of the parts assert the constraints of the schemas, so that the compiler cannot assemble a document that does not serialize.
The frontend side, ``libsolidity/interface/Ethdebug.cpp``, builds the type documents and the pointer templates of a contract from its AST and types.

Type Documents
==============

Which Types Get a Document
--------------------------

The resources of a contract contain a document for

- the types of its state variables in storage and transient storage,
- the types of the parameters and return variables of every function and modifier compiled into the contract: the ones it defines, the ones it inherits, the free functions of the source units it references and the internal functions of the libraries in those source units,
- and, transitively, every type these types are composed of.

The resources of a compilation are the union of the resources of its contracts.
Types are keyed by ``Type::identifier()``, so a type shared between contracts has one document.

A type that only exists at compile time has no document, and neither has a type composed of one.
This concerns literals, type names, modifiers, magic types, modules, inaccessible dynamic types and function types other than internal and external ones.
To terminate on recursive types, a placeholder is registered before the components of a type are visited and replaced by the document afterwards.

References to component types are ``{"type": {"id": <identifier>}}``.
The data location of a reference type is not represented; the located variants of a type are separate entries with the same document.
The members of a struct are taken from ``StructType::members()`` and therefore carry the types they have in the struct's data location, e.g. a ``string`` member of a storage struct references ``t_string_storage``.

A ``definition`` carries the ``name`` of the declaration, unless it is empty, and its source range as the ``location``.
The source ``id`` of the location is the index of the source unit in ``CompilerStack::sourceIndices()``, which is also what the compilation record and the source mappings use.
Definitions without a name and a known location are omitted.

State Variable Pointers
=======================

Every state variable in storage and transient storage of a contract gets a pointer template.
The slot and the byte offset of the variable come from ``ContractType::linearizedStateVariables()``, so that inherited variables are described at the slots they occupy in the contract at hand.
The template is named after the AST IDs of the contract and the variable, ``storage_<contract>_<variable>`` or ``transient_<contract>_<variable>``, and its regions are named after the variable, ``<variable>``, ``<variable>-<member>`` and so on, as described in :ref:`ethdebug`.
A variable name starting with ``$`` is prefixed with ``_`` since it would not be an ethdebug identifier otherwise.

``StateVariablePointerBuilder`` builds the pointer of a variable recursively from its type, starting at the variable's slot.
The kinds of types are laid out as follows, where ``slot`` stands for the expression addressing the base slot of the value at hand, a literal for the variable itself and a computed expression inside arrays and mappings.

Value types
    A single region ``{"location": ..., "name": <name>, "slot": slot}``.
    A value narrower than a word carries its ``length`` in bytes and its ``offset`` in the slot.
    The offset counts from the most significant byte of the slot, as the pointer format's segment addressing does, while the storage layout packs values from the least significant byte: a value of *n* bytes at layout offset *o* starts at byte 32 - *o* - *n*, so a ``uint8`` alone in its slot is at offset 31 and an ``address`` packed after two bytes is at offset 10.
    An offset of zero is omitted.

Static arrays ``T[N]``
    A ``list`` with ``count`` ``N`` and the index variable ``<name>-index``, whose element ``<name>-item`` is:

    - for a value type narrower than a word, packed *k* to a slot from the least significant byte, the region at slot ``slot + index / k``, offset ``$wordsize - (index % k + 1) * size`` and length ``size``,
    - otherwise the pointer of the element type at ``slot + index * slots``, with ``slots`` being the storage size of the element type, omitted when it is one.

Dynamic arrays ``T[]``
    A ``group`` of the region ``<name>-length`` at ``slot`` and a scope defining ``<name>-data`` as ``keccak256(wordsized(slot))``, in which the elements are the list of a static array with ``count`` ``$read(<name>-length)`` starting at ``<name>-data``.

``bytes`` and ``string``
    The compact encoding keeps values shorter than 32 bytes in the slot itself, with twice the length in the lowest byte, and longer values at ``keccak256(slot)``, with twice the length plus one in the slot.
    The pointer is a ``group`` of the region ``<name>-length-flag``, the lowest byte of the slot, and a conditional on ``($read(<name>-length-flag) + 1) % 2``:

    - the short case defines ``<name>-length`` as ``$read(<name>-length-flag) / 2`` for the region ``<name>`` in the slot with that length,
    - the long case is a ``group`` of the region ``<name>-long-length`` at the slot and a scope defining ``<name>-length`` as ``($read(<name>-long-length) - 1) / 2`` and ``<name>-data`` as ``keccak256(wordsized(slot))`` for the region ``<name>`` at ``<name>-data`` with that length.

Structs
    A ``group`` of the pointers of the members, named ``<name>-<member>``, each built from its type at ``slot`` advanced by the member's slot offset and, when packed, at its byte offset.
    A struct nested in itself, which is possible through arrays and mappings, or nested deeper than 16 levels is not decomposed further; it becomes a single region covering its slots.

Mappings ``mapping(K => V)``
    The pointer of the value type ``V`` at ``keccak256(wordsized(key), wordsized(slot))``.
    The key is not stored anywhere; it becomes a parameter of the template, named ``key`` for the outermost mapping of the variable and ``key1``, ``key2`` and so on for mappings nested in its values.
    Keys of value type are hashed as full words; ``bytes`` and ``string`` keys are hashed unpadded.

Transient storage
    The same layouts with the region location ``transient``.

Slot arithmetic on literal slots is folded into the literals, so that the members of a struct at slot 3 are addressed as ``0x03``, ``0x04`` and so on rather than as sums.
The test cases under ``test/libsolidity/ethdebugTests/resources/`` show the complete type and pointer tables for each of these layouts and are the reference for their exact shape.
